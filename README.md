# Topological data analysis implementation example

Below is an easy implementation of a labelling algorithm which uses persistant homology.

## Introduction

I implemented this code during an internship, I was really interested in topological data analysis and tried to use it for a classification task. The code allows, when given some labelled vectors (training data), to predict the labels of the vectors around it with high precision (testing data). The goal of this code is to make the algorithm accessible to people who don't necessarily have a strong background in algebraic topology. 

## Implementation of the paper CLASSIFICATION BASED ON TOPOLOGICAL DATA ANALYSIS

This project implements the pseudocode presented in the paper titled "CLASSIFICATION BASED ON TOPOLOGICAL DATA ANALYSIS" by Rolando Kindelan, José Frías, Mauricio Cerda
 and Nancy Hitschfeld. The paper can be found arXiv:2102.03709.
